# Overview
In this project I wanted to learn JavaScript and also be able to learn how to use an api while still being practical, adn something that could be used by myself or anyone else from day to day. I created this weather app to have something very simple and easy to use, have it be very readable and appealing to look at and use. I also wanted to learn how to get JavaScript to work hand in hand with HTML and CSS.

When creating the app, after writing the HTML and CSS, I was able to learn more about event listeners and how they work. When the user types in a city, the information will not be refreshed until the user hits enter. I was also able to learn about date builders and query selectors to generate the needed weather information.

I wrote this software to mainly learn JavaScript, but also to create something that I could use, and it would stretch me to create it. I wanted to do something I had never done before, and that is here I began researching about api's and came upon the idea to create a weather app.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment
I used Visual Studio Code tow write all of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript. While I did not import any libraries, I used an api from Open Weather's free api to keep track of the weather, location, hi-low's and all other information associated with it.

# Future Work
- Be able to switch from imperial measurements to metric and back.
- The ability to see the forecast for the next few days
- Be able to have an hourly forecast
